# pdac

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of developing PDAC. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and validation using algorithms like decision trees, SVM, and random forest. The project aims to assist in early diagnosis of PDAC, improving patient prognosis.
